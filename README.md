# incremental_backup
Script for doing jwz backups (http://www.jwz.org/doc/backups.html) plus a little more. It creates a new full backup every night, but uses rsync's nifty hard linking ability so that each backup hard links to files that haven't changed from the night before (google "rsync incremental backup" for lots of examples of this). It also removes old backups according to thresholds set in variables in the script. For example, you can have it keep a backup for every night for a week, and then only monthly backups for 4 months, and delete all others. This keeps your backup disk from getting full. This is pretty much just MeWare, but I share in case maybe it can help someone else and become UsWare :-)
